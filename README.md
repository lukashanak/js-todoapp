# js-todoapp
### Simple todo app made in javascript. I'll probably make some new features soon, like a storing data to local storage etc.
### Live demo here: https://lukashanak.github.io/js-todoapp/index.html

## Functions
### #1 use enter to add todo
### #2 click to task to mark it as finished / not finished (made for simplicity, I love this on phone)
### #3 click to trash icon if you want to delete the task
